The Math Talk expands on the concept of the Conic Sections, where the Conic Sections can describe a higher dimensional shape, in this case a cone. This app shows quadric surfaces, which are cross sections of a 4-D shape. By exposing ourselves as much as possible to these cross sections, could potential help describe a 4D shape!"
