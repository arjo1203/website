The gadget reports a horizontal and vertical angle per each photodector. With a very clever positioning algorithm, our project was very close to being completed. Gladly, the purpose of the project was to demonstrate that we were able to build a fully functioning electrical system. My main contribution to the project was hardware design, consisting of a transimpedance amplifier and PCB design and assembly."
