The gadget can interface with the HTC Vive Lighthouse and convert the IR light signals into patterns that can be converted in to angles. With a very clever posititioning algorithm, the trackable gadget providea the neccessary information to be positioned related to the Lighthouse. My main contribution to the project was hardware design consisting of a transimpedance amplifier and PCB design and assembly."
